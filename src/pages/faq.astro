    question: 'What databases do you support?',
    answer: 'We support PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, AWS Athena, Redshift, and more. Connect to virtually any SQL database.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my data secure?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. We use AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, and are SOC 2 compliant. We never store your raw data - only schema metadata for query generation.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you train AI on my data?',
    answer: 'No. Your data is never used to train our AI models. We may use anonymized, aggregated usage patterns to improve our service, but never your actual data.'

  {
    question: 'How accurate are the AI-generated queries?',

  {
    question: 'What is a semantic layer?',
    answer: 'A semantic layer is a business abstraction that defines metrics and terms in your language. It ensures "revenue" means the same thing across all queries and users.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I connect my database?',
    answer: 'Connection takes about 5 minutes. You\'ll provide connection details (host, credentials) and we\'ll securely connect. We support OAuth for services like BigQuery.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I embed AnswerLayer in my product?',
    answer: 'Yes! Our Pro plan includes APIs for embedding conversational analytics in your own applications. Perfect for building AI-powered features for your users.'
