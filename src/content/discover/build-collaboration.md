Semantic layers are shared artifacts. Collaboration features:

- **Role-based access** — Different permissions for different team members
- **Comments and discussions** — Threaded conversations on definitions
- **Change requests** — Propose modifications without direct edit access
- **Notifications** — Alerts when relevant definitions change

The goal: treat the semantic layer as a living document that the whole data team owns.
