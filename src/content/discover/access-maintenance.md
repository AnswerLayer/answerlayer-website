Databases change. The semantic layer should change with them:

- **Schema changes detected** — New tables and columns flagged for review
- **Re-generation available** — Run generation again to pick up changes
- **Curated definitions preserved** — Locked items survive re-generation
- **Diff review** — See exactly what changed before accepting updates

Maintenance is minimal compared to traditional semantic layers. Instead of updating YAML files, review and approve suggestions.
