Security is a partnership. The BYOC model means clear boundaries:

**You secure:**
- Your VPC and network configuration
- Database credentials and access policies
- Data governance and user permissions

**We secure:**
- Application code and dependencies
- Updates and security patches
- Control plane infrastructure

This model simplifies compliance. Your data never crosses boundaries you don't control, and audit scope stays within your existing infrastructure.
