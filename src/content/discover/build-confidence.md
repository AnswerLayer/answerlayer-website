Confidence scores are calibrated against human judgments. When reviewers override AI inferences, the feedback improves future generations. Over time, the system learns organization-specific patterns:

- Internal naming conventions
- Business-specific terminology
- Domain-specific relationships

This creates a feedback loop: the more the semantic layer is curated, the better future generations become.
