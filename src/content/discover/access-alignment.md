Organizations suffer from data misalignment:

- **Different teams pull different numbers** — Sales says revenue is X, finance says Y
- **Definitions drift over time** — What "active user" means changes but nobody updates the dashboard
- **New hires struggle to find anything** — Tribal knowledge locked in senior employees' heads
- **AI tools hallucinate** — ChatGPT invents plausible-sounding but wrong queries

The semantic layer creates alignment. One definition. One source of truth. Every question answered consistently.

The result: confident decisions, faster onboarding, and AI that actually works.
