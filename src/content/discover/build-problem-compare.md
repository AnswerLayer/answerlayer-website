| Aspect | Traditional Tools | AnswerLayer |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Initial setup | Weeks of configuration | Minutes of generation |
| Schema changes | Manual updates required | Re-generation with diff review |
| New metrics | Write YAML, test, deploy | Suggest or generate, approve |
| PII handling | Manual tagging | AI detection with override |
| Business context | Comments in config files | First-class semantic metadata |

The fundamental difference: traditional tools require humans to translate business knowledge into configuration. AnswerLayer generates configuration from data analysis, with humans curating the result.
