The vision: every organization should have a semantic layer. Today, only the most sophisticated data teams can afford the investment. AnswerLayer makes semantic layers accessible to any organization with a database.

The business model: subscription software priced on value delivered. Larger deployments with more queries and more users pay more. Smaller deployments have accessible entry points.

The market: the semantic layer category is emerging. dbt Semantic Layer, Cube, AtScale, and others are validating the need. AnswerLayer differentiates through generation—reducing the barrier to entry from weeks to minutes.
