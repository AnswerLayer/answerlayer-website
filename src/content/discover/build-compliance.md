Your data stays in your infrastructure, in your region. The BYOC deployment model means customer data never crosses into AnswerLayer-controlled systems—simplifying compliance with data residency and sovereignty requirements.

**Security foundations:**
- Secure development lifecycle with code review and static analysis
- Penetration testing and vulnerability management
- Encrypted credential handling (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit)
- Third-party IAM monitoring and audit platform
- Control plane isolated from customer data

**In progress:**
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- Liability insurance
- Business continuity policies
