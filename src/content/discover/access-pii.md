Personal data requires special handling:

- **AI detection** — Columns scanned for email, phone, SSN patterns
- **Confidence scoring** — Detection certainty shown for review
- **Flexible controls** — Block, mask, or allow with audit trail
- **Compliance support** — GDPR, HIPAA compatible configurations

PII decisions are logged. Auditors can see who accessed what, when, and why it was allowed.
