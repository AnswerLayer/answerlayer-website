Every inference is logged. Full traces and observability are available for:

- **Auditing** — Understand why a definition exists
- **Debugging** — Trace unexpected results back to their source
- **Review** — Evaluate suggestions before accepting them

Nothing is a black box. If you need to understand the details of an analysis, the reasoning is there.
