Curation is typically done by:

- **Analytics engineers** — Understand both data and business
- **Data analysts** — Know how metrics are actually used
- **Domain experts** — Understand business rules and edge cases

The curation interface requires no code. Point and click to rename, edit, or extend. Technical users can also edit the underlying configuration directly.
