AnswerLayer approaches alignment through automation:

1. **Generate** — AI analyzes the database and creates initial definitions
2. **Curate** — Domain experts review and refine
3. **Share** — Everyone queries through the same semantic layer
4. **Evolve** — As the business changes, definitions update

The key insight: alignment requires shared definitions, but creating definitions from scratch is too much work. Generation provides the starting point. Curation ensures accuracy. Sharing creates the culture.
