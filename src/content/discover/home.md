AnswerLayer generates a semantic layer from any database. A semantic layer is a business ontology—a concept map that humans and AI can navigate together. It aligns organizations with their data through shared definitions. Entities, metrics, dimensions, and relationships are created automatically by analyzing actual data, not just schema.

The result: consistent answers, confident decisions, and a data culture where everyone speaks the same language.
