Semantic layer changes are tracked:

- **Diff view** — See what changed between generations
- **Approval workflow** — Changes require review before activation
- **Rollback** — Revert to previous versions instantly
- **Audit trail** — Who changed what, when, and why

Integration with git workflows is optional. The semantic layer can be exported as configuration files for version control, or managed entirely within AnswerLayer.
