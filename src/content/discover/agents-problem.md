Agents without semantic layers:

- **Hallucinate queries** — Invent columns and relationships
- **Expose sensitive data** — No awareness of PII
- **Break things** — Run expensive or destructive queries
- **Produce inconsistent results** — No shared definitions

Agents with semantic layers:

- **Query accurately** — Grounded in real schema
- **Respect privacy** — PII controls enforced
- **Stay safe** — Guardrails prevent damage
- **Deliver consistent answers** — Same definitions as humans
