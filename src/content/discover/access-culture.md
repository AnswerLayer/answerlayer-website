Data culture is how an organization relates to its information. Strong data culture means:

- **Shared language** — Everyone uses the same terms with the same meanings
- **Self-service** — People answer their own questions without waiting
- **Trust** — Numbers are believed because definitions are transparent
- **Iteration** — Easy to ask follow-up questions and explore

The semantic layer is infrastructure for data culture. It makes the implicit explicit. It turns tribal knowledge into shared knowledge.

Organizations with strong data culture make better decisions faster. They have higher revenue per employee because information flows efficiently.
