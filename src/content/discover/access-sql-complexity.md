SQL is powerful but demanding:

- JOIN syntax is unintuitive
- Window functions are arcane
- Date handling varies by database
- Performance tuning requires expertise

Business users should not need SQL to answer business questions. AnswerLayer translates natural language to correct SQL, handling complexity automatically.
