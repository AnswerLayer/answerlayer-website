MCP is an emerging standard for connecting AI models to external systems. AnswerLayer provides an MCP server that exposes:

- **Available entities** — What can be queried
- **Available metrics** — What measurements exist
- **Query tool** — Execute natural language queries
- **Schema tool** — Inspect semantic layer structure

Agents using MCP can discover and use AnswerLayer automatically.
