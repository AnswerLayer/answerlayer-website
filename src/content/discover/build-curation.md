Generation provides a starting point. Curation makes it accurate.

Key capabilities:
- **Lock definitions** — Mark authoritative items that won't change during re-generation
- **Approve changes** — Review and accept suggestions before they take effect
- **Preserve work** — Curated definitions survive schema changes and updates

The process is accelerated by NLP—what traditionally takes months of manual configuration happens in hours, with humans focused on judgment rather than data entry.
