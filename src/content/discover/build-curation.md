Generation provides a starting point. Curation makes it accurate. The curation workflow:

- **Review generated entities** — Confirm or rename business objects
- **Adjust relationships** — Fix incorrectly inferred joins
- **Refine metrics** — Edit SQL expressions, add business rules
- **Lock definitions** — Mark curated items as authoritative
- **Add context** — Business descriptions, ownership, documentation links

Locked definitions are preserved across re-generations. New schema elements generate new suggestions without overwriting curated work.
