**Where does AnswerLayer run?**
In your cloud infrastructure (AWS or GCP). BYOC deployment means your data stays in your region.

**Does data leave customer infrastructure?**
No. Queries execute against the database. Raw data is never exported. This supports data sovereignty requirements.

**How are database credentials handled?**
Encrypted and stored in your cloud secret manager. Never transmitted to AnswerLayer.

**Is AnswerLayer SOC 2 compliant?**
SOC 2 Type II certification is in progress.
