AnswerLayer has open source components:

- **Query parser** — Natural language to semantic query translation
- **Schema analyzer** — Database introspection and sampling
- **Semantic types** — Type definitions for entities, metrics, dimensions

Contributions welcome in all areas. The core generation logic uses proprietary models, but the surrounding infrastructure is open.
