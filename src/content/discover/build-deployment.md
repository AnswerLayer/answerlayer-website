Two deployment models:

**Self-hosted (VPC)**
- Full control over infrastructure
- Data never leaves the network
- Customer manages updates and scaling

**Managed**
- AnswerLayer operates the infrastructure
- Automatic updates and scaling
- Data still isolated per customer

Both models use the same codebase. Switching between them is possible.
