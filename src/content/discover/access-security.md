Data security is non-negotiable:

- **VPC deployment** — AnswerLayer runs in customer infrastructure
- **No data export** — Queries execute against the database; raw data stays put
- **Encrypted credentials** — Database passwords never leave the cloud
- **Audit logging** — Every query recorded for compliance
