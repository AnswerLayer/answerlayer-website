The data team is a bottleneck. Every question joins a queue:

- Simple questions wait behind complex projects
- Context gets lost between request and delivery
- Follow-up questions restart the cycle
- Urgent requests disrupt planned work

Self-service analytics promises to solve this but fails when users cannot write SQL or do not know the schema. AnswerLayer makes self-service actually work by enabling plain language questions.
