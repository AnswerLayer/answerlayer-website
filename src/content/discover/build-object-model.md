Here's an example of a semantic layer object model:

- **Entities** — Core business objects like Customer, Order, Product (mapped to database tables)
- **Measures** — Direct aggregations like total revenue, order count, average value
- **Metrics** — Business calculations like growth rate, conversion rate, lifetime value
- **Dimensions** — Attributes for grouping like region, category, segment
- **Filters** — Reusable conditions like active users, last 30 days, high value

These objects connect to form a navigable map of your business domain.
