The semantic layer is composed of interconnected objects that define your data's business meaning:

- **Entities** — Core business objects like Customer, Order, Product (mapped to database tables)
- **Measures** — Direct aggregations on entity columns (sums, counts, averages)
- **Metrics** — Business-level calculations built from measures (simple, ratio, or derived)
- **Dimensions** — Attributes used for grouping and segmentation
- **Filters** — Reusable conditions for common data slices

Together, these objects form a navigable map of your business domain.
