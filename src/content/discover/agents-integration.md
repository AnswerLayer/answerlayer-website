AnswerLayer provides multiple integration points:

- **REST API** — Standard HTTP interface for any agent framework
- **MCP Server** — Native integration with Model Context Protocol
- **Python SDK** — For agents built in Python
- **TypeScript SDK** — For agents built in JavaScript/TypeScript

Agents authenticate with API keys. Permissions are scoped per key—different agents can have different access levels.
