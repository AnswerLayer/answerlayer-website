Generation provides a draft. Experts make it accurate:

- **Review entities** — Confirm the business objects make sense
- **Refine metrics** — Adjust calculations to match business rules
- **Add context** — Descriptions that help users understand what is available
- **Lock definitions** — Mark authoritative definitions that should not change

Curation is where business knowledge enters the system. The AI handles the tedious mapping work. Humans provide the judgment.
