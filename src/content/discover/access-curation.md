When "revenue" means different things to different teams, someone has to decide. Curation is governance:

- **Ownership** — Assign definition owners by domain
- **Conflict resolution** — Surface when teams use terms differently
- **Approval workflows** — Changes to authoritative definitions require sign-off
- **Audit trail** — Track who changed what, when, and why
