AnswerLayer queries your data where it lives. No ETL, no data movement, no copies.

**Data sources**
Connect directly to your existing data warehouse or databases. The semantic layer sits on top—it doesn't require migrating or duplicating data.

**Context sources**
Enrich the semantic layer with context from tools your team already uses—documentation, project management, communication platforms. The more context, the better the answers.
