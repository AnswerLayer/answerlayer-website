Traditional semantic layers require weeks of manual configuration. AnswerLayer generates a complete semantic model in minutes:

- **Entities identified** — Customer, Order, Product, Employee
- **Metrics defined** — Revenue, Churn Rate, Average Order Value
- **Dimensions created** — Region, Category, Time Period
- **Relationships mapped** — How tables connect

Generation analyzes actual data, not just schema metadata. This reveals business meaning that schema alone cannot show.
