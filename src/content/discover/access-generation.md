Traditional semantic layers require months of manual configuration—and become outdated the moment something changes.

AnswerLayer takes a different approach:

- **Interactive capture** — Experts work with the system to define entities, relationships, measures, metrics, dimensions, and filters
- **Synonyms and terminology** — Capture org-specific language, acronyms, and the different ways people refer to the same thing
- **Temporal annotations** — Record significant events that impacted the data (reorgs, pricing changes, system migrations)
- **Continuous updates** — Definitions evolve with usage as business logic changes

The result isn't a static dictionary. It's living institutional knowledge that stays current.
